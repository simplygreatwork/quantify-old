- This project is research for creating a tiny web-runnable quantum computer simulator which is reasonably performant.
- A significant portion of the current state of this repository has been extracted from Davy Wybiral's [qcsimulator](qcsimulator.github.io) [LICENSE](https://github.com/qcsimulator/qcsimulator.github.io/blob/master/LICENSE)
- My intent is to create [numerous examples](https://observablehq.com/@simplygreatwork) which clearly illustrate practical effects of quantum computing operations.
- I might also incorporate [phase circle notation](http://davidbkemp.github.io/animated-qubits/) [2](https://oreilly-qc.github.io/).
- I might also translate this to AssemblyScript to run as a WebAssembly module.
